Review
We’ve accomplished a lot! We learned what middleware is and we’ve used it to write cleaner, readable, adaptable, and maintainable code. We’ve written functions that are context aware and can have overlapping functionality without duplicating code. We can serve data by route, with each possible endpoint being treated as a separate relative of the family of our application. We learned to link these middleware using next() to continue to the next middleware in the stack. We’ve reduced complexity in our codebase by relying on external, open-source middleware. We are truly harnessing the power of the Express web server, the Node environment, and our knowledge of Javascript. Let’s review those skills.

In the workspace there is another codebase with a set of familiar problems. Custom middleware to accomplish tasks we could be importing a module for. Duplicated code throughout the different routes. Improperly managed middleware stack missing next() calls. You will need everything learned in this lesson, but it’s nothing you haven’t done before.
